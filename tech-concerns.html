 <h4> While this site is dedicated to celebrate the advancements of technology, in order to paint the full
   picture of the technology landscape world wide, we must take a look at the challenges each area of the world
   faces while developing it's technology.
 </h4><br><br>
 <h3  class="country-names"> North America </h3> <br>
<h4>
  Slow policy execution and scalability are at the forefront of our challenges. The acceleration of
  other tech hubs world-wide threaten to take the thunder from North America leading innovation. Another concern is 
    that defense technology is produced via a complex world network.
</h4><br>
<h4>
 The competitveness of the rest of the world also poses a threat to North America's advancement in tech.
 Currently American government funded advancements in Artificial Intelligence and quantative science have not been innovative, significant,  or scalable
 enough to stay competitive.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  More government funding is needed to stay competitive and innovative. A lot of innovation occurs in 
  universities, making them worthy areas to receive this increase in income.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="us-comparison.png" alt="Map that puts different countries in categories of where they are in digital evolution."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  America needs to make sure it has a strong pool of local and international talent. An important part of the conversation
  is making sure those who come to universities in the US from other countries have an easy time staying here.

</h4><br>
<h4>
  China is viewed as potentially the biggest competitor and threat (due to past unfair trade policies) to innovation in 
  the US. They also graduate 3 times as many STEM graduates as we do. They are also expected to be the 
  leading funders of research by 2030. The US however, remains a central part of the international production.
  This helps make up for the financial differences.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  This creates alliances which the US can use to its advantage. These will allow for developing a 
  standard for innovation going forward.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="us-job-stats.png" alt="Statement that 3.5 million STEM roles will be created by 2025."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  The US also needs to develop a strategy for being a real leader in technology. If it fails to do this,
  not only might other countries become stronger defense threats, but America potentially no longer being
  seen as the leader of innovation can make the alliances it developed in the tech sphere be less beneficial
  since America will not be seen as the top country for innovation and ideas.

<h4>
  The above section and source article of course, soley focuses on America. However, how are things for Mexico?
  That question can be answered by looking at conditions on South America.
</h4>
<br><br>
<h3  class="country-names"> South America </h3> <br>
<h4>
  Changes in environment, gross class inequalities, and increasing numbers of violent crimes all threaten 
  the progression of Latin American technology.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Resource depletion and environmental destruction are the particular environmental threats to Latin America's technology innovation
  The loss in quantity and increasing of pricing increase the challenge of advancing in the technical world. 
  Conflict born from these problems will only make the setback worse. This forces us to consider a new set of questions.
  If these issues can't be stopped, how can Latin America readjust to these difficult conditions and still
  thrive?
</h4> <br>
<h4>
  Man made contributions to climate change and the strain the international demands for international products
  cost on local environments and people are also a concern to deal with. Relatively large scale brain drain is also a threat to the advancement of Latin America's tech growth.
Meanwhile locally, inequality makes governing the different areas in the region difficult. Financial distribution
and ruling benefit are not equally distributed. Major life expectancy and quality increases around the world
have made these inequalities more obvious. Ways to conquer these inequalities have proven to grow archaic 
and in some cases prove to be ineffective.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="south-vulnerability.jpg" alt="South American map that highlights how much climate vulnerability each area has."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  With that in mind the increase in violence in the area is still worrying.The less organized nature of 
  present day violence makes it harder to pinpoint and stop. The new ways people use every day items 
  to commit horrible crimes makes it hard to make laws that prevent these violent tragedies without stripping
  people of essential items and supplies. It's tough to determine what in society should be changed and what should remain the same.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="violence-contribution.jpg" alt="South American map that highlights how much climate vulnerability each area has."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  Massive concentration of people on urban areas is the biggest source of pollution that troubles Latin 
  America. Pollution comes from airborne pollution of course, but also poor sanitary infrastructure.
  Many don't even have access to running water because of this. Droughts have been getting worse and more frequent, making everything
  worse. This is overwhelming the systems in place making things more difficult. In non urban areas, 
  deforestation and higher temperatures are a huge threat. Brazil particularly is struggling with this. The water in the Andes is being threatened.
  Higher temperatures also create worse outbreaks in diseases.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  As with anywhere in the world, the people who suffer most are the poorest of the area.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  South America has 25% of the world's freshwater. This is not impacted by climate change. As pointed out before however,
  water is very unevenly distributed throughout the continent. This may make water a very scarce, sacred commodity to bargin with.

</h4><br>

<img class="stat-image" src="population-density.png" alt="Map of global population density."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  How South America deals with it's struggles is very important, but things look difficult due to the concentrated
  urban population and poor governing infrastructure. On the bright side, the natural resources the continent
  do have are abundant, allowing people to live off these resources potentially even if completely isolated
  from the rest of the world.It proves this by being much less reliant on outside countries than other regions.
This however has lead to South America to be stuck in the 19th century in it's progress in global trade.
What it trades tends to be basic natural resurces / vegetation. It's trade network also only relies on 
North America and China which can pose a threat if those alliances break down for any reason.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="biggest-supplier.gif" alt="Map that shows each area of the world's largest supplier."></img><br><br>


<h4>
  Unequal seperate countries make the inequalities stronger due to worse political infrastructures being built.
  Recently things have gotten better in large part due to money transfer programs helping jumpstart 
  local economies. Minimum wages have been increased as well.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Labor unions are being attempted, but are weak and/ or don't represent non-traditional workers so they 
  end up not helping the inequalities.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  The rate of improvement seems to have decreased in recent years. Cash transfers put too much of a strain
  on public funds to be a substainable ender of inequality. Also solving financial inequality doesn't touch
  other sources of inequality such as environment and housing. This has increase anxiety for politicians.
  The inequalities change peoples' perceptions of fairness and justice which impacts societal actions.
  One of these things that plays into politics is the organized violence in the region. Politicians use 
  this to justify policies that violate human rights.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="political-unrest.jpg" alt="South Americans rebelling against poor living conditions."></img><br><br>


<h4>
  The rate of violence rates throughout the continent is vast. Dynamic family structure and crumbling 
  societal structures contribute to this rate. How the goverment deals with drug markets are also an issue.
  The way the governmet of each country deals with these markets is by far the biggest gauger of the severity
  of the illegal drug market. These issues with violence control have gotten to a point where if someone witnesses a criminal act
  the average citizen is left to believe no police action will be taken. Confidence in the court system is also low
  so contract carryout probably won't happen.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="helping-families.jpg" alt="South Americans seeking refuge in the US."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  Poor infrastructure does not help the overall situation. Part of this is caused by a significant amount 
  of income being made by informal work making it difficult to collect taxes to build said infrastructure,
This also makes it so workers cannot be properly protected. This decreases faith in the legtimacy in government
itself.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  If South America made it's trade more global, the money earned can lead to a huge boost in the economy Andes
  begin to solve the local issues. It also could help solve the illegal drug and arms selling that is already international 
  anyway.

<h3  class="country-names"> Asia </h3> <br>
<h4>
  Asia's information technology is coming under much regulation. This makes it difficult for tech businesses
  in the regional and international market. Conducting business using user data for example, is a legal and very profitable
  business strategy in some countries in Asia, but comepletely illegal in other countries with high penalties.
  These legal differences across the continent give challenges for compliance teams and strategists all over.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Some countries have resorted to using political alliences to bypass these limitations to boost them up and also
  hurt other tech businesses through hostility from said alliance. On top of this, countries have resorted 
  to data onshoring, using data security as an excuse for preventing data from crossing borders. These problems
  are arguably more prominent in customer facing jobs. Negative information spread in this climate is a 
  lot more difficult to stop. People are influenced by competition to spread this misinformation but it
  makes this problem very obvious. Strategic positive campaigns about said product or business have proven
  capable of reversing the damage of negative campaigns.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  This situation however emphasizes the importance of these social vulnerabilities being dealt with. 
  These horrible tactics include implanting false data into businesses such as ordering fake taxi rides
  IP tampering, and even implanting fake employee moles. 
  The hyper competitive nature of the tech market makes this a bigger threat but has also lead to efforts
  to stop these horrible acts to significantly increase. 
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="trade-growth.png" alt="Line graph showing the rate of increase of each country's imports and exports."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  Data security is also an issue that needs to be considered. This is especially important when local companies
  partner with overseas companies. Some companies have been helped by the government to overcome this obstacle
  but it doesn't change that this is a concern. Cyber criminals directly targeting companies ias also a threat.
  Fast growing and young tech companies are their biggest target, especially because young companies 
  are likely to be less secure than more experienced companies. Factoring risk management becomes very costly 
  and often requires restructuring of a company. This can impact any company of any size. This causes extra vulnerability
  to financial and intellectual property loss. In higher regulated sectors of the economy, a cyber attack
  can lead to a regulatory sanction or even loss of operating license.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="china-competition.jpg" alt="Map showing trade patterns of companies worldwide."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  Overseas companies that want to invest in these Asian companies need to factor in this regulatory risk cost.
  The timelines it takes to reach regulatory compliance needs to also be considered. Lastly, the cost 
  of frequent changes needs to be considered.
  
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Companies also need to have a deep understanding of how their rival companies operate and what threat
  they pose to that company and be able to develop campaigns to counter these threats. With the above mentioned
  threats, it's now more important than others. Keeping stakeholders engaged is also more important than ever.
Case studies to study the effects of different scenarios before a major product release is also important.
</h4> <br>
<img class="stat-image" src="world-competition.jpg" alt="Map showing trade patterns of companies worldwide."></img><br><br>


<h4>
  It's a good idea for tech investors to do their research on companies to make sure they have proper cyber
  security measures in place. This needs to include making sure leadership and good oversight / planning 
  is very important.
</h4> <br>

<h3  class="country-names"> Australia </h3> <br>
<h4>
  Consumer protection and privacy laws are the biggest concern in Australia. These improvements would 
  allow people to have more control over the influences of tech companies in their lives.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Australia's consumer watch dog has suggested an inclusion of a right to request erasure of data from 
  tech companies, choosing whether internet traffic is tracked, high fees for consumer companies that misuse
  consumer information. They should also face these fines if they have unfair private policies or policies that 
  don't default to settings where the user's safety is top priority.Australians' concern about data misusage has been proven to be increasing with time. Privacy policies
  they are presented with are also too difficult to understand they feel. Companies have been revealed 
  to have incentives to misuse consumer data by hiding their true objectives for the collected data. This 
  prevents pushback. This also preserves companies power hold over markets, harms consumer, and worst of all 
  it gives a negative incentive in creating competitive safe private policies.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="data-sweeper.jpg" alt="Picture of broom sweeping social media apps and binary bits."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  What's worse is that pirvacy policies create obstacles for people to opt out of privacy violating practices.
  They conviniently leave out what really happens to users' information, taking away their real ability 
  to choose. Some policies are even misleading.
</h4><br>
<h4>
Australia's Competition and Consumer Comission  is investigating privacy practies of Facebook and Google under Australia Consumer Law. They've
already took action against HealthEdge, a medical appointment booking app, for selling consumer information
to insurance brokers. Consumers are often ignorant of the exact information that's being collected from 
them and the danger it can bring them. A report from the Consumer Policy Research Centre has revealed that 
these companies that take information from consumers, data analysts, data brokers, and data aggregators 
are companies people have never heard of. The information is even sold to political parties.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="person-looking.jpg" alt="Picture of person investigating social media apps' share values."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  Data companies sort people into lists based on private information. The US FCC confirms this. Knowing which
  lists a user falls into are able to paint a whole picture about someone, down to what they do on a 
  day to day basis.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  The more times this happens, the bigger the risk consumers have to be harmed by this information distribution.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Right off the bat, this can lead to higher risks of fraud and identity theft. One in ten Australians 
  fall victim to these crimes. Hihgher retial prices and insurance preniums can be encountered based 
  off online activity. What's worse is this combined with information from other sources can lead to the most
  intimate information about a person being revealed.
</h4> <br>
<h4>
  Lists of sexual assault victims, those with sexually transmitted diseases, Alzheimers, demnentia, 
  sexual impotence, and mental health issues have been revealed in US House of Representitive written 
  testimony. There are even lists of people suceptible to buy things based off certain ads shown to them.

</h4> <br>
<img class="stat-image" src="bird-cage.png" alt="Bird trapped in digital cage."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  The ACCC finds that Australia's policies falls behind those of the EU and are a threat to peoples' trust 
  in companies.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="world-privacy.jpg" alt="Map that shows the status of data privacy laws in different parts of the world."></img><br><br>

<h4>
Laws used to deal with unfair contract terms can be used to help deal with unfair user data usage. this
though only takes care of unfair terms in privacy policies. It's suggested therefore that, this policy get strengthened for 
both usages, by adding a high penalty. The government has acknowledged there is a need for vetter laws 
but has not taken action yet to solve this issue.

<h3  class="country-names"> Africa </h3> <br>
<h4>
  Debates are occuring all around the world about Huawei's involvement in the integration of 5G technology in Africa.
  Huawei is a Shenzhen, China based company. The US has applied pressure not to allow them to take part but 
  the UK approved it. This due to US concerns that Huawei will act as an extended part of the Chinese government
  and will use this technology to spy on African countries in this case. Africans have other concerns about 
  this development however.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Huawei built a majority of Africa's 4G infrastructure. They are suspected of to have sold technology to
  repressive governments due to "Safe City" initiatives, underminding human rights.
</h4><br>
<h4>
The safe city initiatives are Huawei's flagship security initiative to assist local governments keep 
areas safe. Over 700 cities, including many in China use these technologies.
</h4><br>
<h4>
Sub-Saharan Africa has 12 such Safe City initiatives so far throughout the area. Eight of those cities are 
in countries in that are deemed either only partially free or not free countries.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  The biggest specific concerns are that facial recognition and social media monitoring via these systems
  will violate human rights. 
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="african-protest.jpg" alt="Africans protesting goverment invasions of privacy."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  Uganda alone spent $126 million dollars on facial recognition cameras alone. Ethiopia has used security 
  technology from private companies for years to squash rebellions of the opressive government for years.
Other companies have even accused Huawei of giving Uganda and Zambia technology to track opposition
politicians in their country. Huawei, along with Ugandan and Zambian authorities have denied these claims.
</h4><br>

<h4>
When Huawei however, was asked if they would introduce safeguards to protect people's privacy, they responded
by saying they don't write public policy, that's up to governments.Basically stepping away from any potential 
responsibilities of the bad that can come from misuse of their technology.They only sell the technology, they say.

</h4><br>
<h4>
  Lack of regulatory safeguards and privacy legislation have drastically increased concerns over potentially
  privacy violating technology.Many African countries are still grappling with the fundamentals of privacy 
  and data protection.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  This raises questions of the compliance of international regulations, fairness and proportionate. The concern
  for violence and unrest are the justification for years of private company security being used.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Huawei uses decrease in crime rates to justify it's technology. They claimed many of the benefits are unknown
  to the general public since police keeps it secret for security reasons.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  The lack of information about the performance of these technologies has raised concerns. The positives seem 
  difficult to verify and grossly exaggerated.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="safe-concerns.jpg" alt="Security system with messages of the flaws of said systems."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  Public safety vs human right violation impacts have continued to be highly debated topics. Increasingly
  sophisticated technology continuing to be introduced keeps these conversations alive. Better regulations and legal 
  protections of human rights are needed, otherwise apprehension of these technologies will remain.

<h3  class="country-names"> Antartica </h3> <br>
<h4>
  Increases in tourism are already worrying, given Antartica's delicate land and climate. The polution and 
  animal hunting and endangerment humans offer to Antartica's ecosystems is tough enough to deal with.
However, oil and gas developments potentially becoming allowed in the future will provide whole new threats
to the area. Previously, the harsh climate and lack of suitable technologies left energy companies with 
little interest to pursue oil and gas procurement in the region.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="penguin-threat.jpg" alt="Picture of people visiting penguins in Antartica."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  Alaska's Northern slopes becoming a huge source for oil in recent history however, has raised concern
  for Antartica's potential future.
</h4>
<h4> Australia demanding to have the ability to install military technology in the area also poses potential risks
  to Antartica's climate and animal inhabitants living there.

<h3  class="country-names"> Europe </h3> <br>
<h4>
  Europe faces challenges due to social media, advanced technology, and artificial intelligence. So much in fact,
  these challenges threaten Europe's power on the world stage.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Russia constantly is waging hybrid warfare using misinformation campaigns to win support for the pro-Moscow political forces.
  The Belt and Road operation is picking the brain of Europe's best engineers, and American technology and social media giants
  threatens to overwhelm Europe's economic affluance and ethical values. These companies pay little tax and threaten European data privacy.
  Europe has fallen behind in social media, ecommerce, and cloud computing. If Europe can't keep up, it will fall
  into a harsh economic decline. Europe is pursuing groundbreaking rules for the digital era. Tim Cook,
  Apple's CEO, has praised the EU for creating the most ambitious internet privacy law in the world, turning Europe into a 
  role model for others to follow. 
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Innovation promotion is still lagging however. Banks are reluctant to loan money to companies that can't 
  show proof of high levels of profitability up front. Also culturally, people seem less motivated to take 
  risks and prefer safer life -long government careers that come with great perks. Fourtunately, some cities are starting to see 
  the emergence of startup culture.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  2007's recession still drives fear and uncertainty for many in the economy's strength. Europe must grow
  economically however because overseas countries are posing stronger and stronger threats to Europe's already
  poor economic health.
</h4><br>
<img class="stat-image" src="russia-threat.jpg" alt="Display of Russia's radiating threat on Europe."></img><br><br>

<h4>
  Russia aims to justify it's cyber warfare via the Gerasimov government on Europe and others, by 
  justifying it as not war or peace, but a grayzone. 
</h4><br>
<h4> Putin is hoping to restore the Soviet Union's former sphere
  of influence.Back in 2007 Russia led a government debilating cyber attack  on Estonia throwing Russia over scrutiny.
They;ve continued to attack other European countries, and even the EU. Russia has proved it can potentially
reach Putin's goals. Russia has done this using Western and Chinese technical platforms, preventing the cyber warfare from 
being costly. This, when combined with artificial intelligence makes the spreading of fake news easy and scalable.
</h4><br>
<h4>
This is in spite of Russia lagging behind in artificial intelligence research. Due to strategic campaigns,
they only end up spending 12.5 million dollars on AI research per year and can still mangle US and European 
political elections.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Putin has also strengthened Russia's tech scene by calling for students to studty information technology 
  and artificial intelligence, saying technology and AI is the future of humanity.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Russia's decisions are possibly partially influenced by Russia's dwindling popilation and oil reserves pushing
  Putin to desire a more vast sphere of influence. Video to Video Synthesis is also used for photo manipulation and videos.
   Due to Russia's attacks and influence in Germany, Germany ordered a complete overhaul on Parliment's 
   computer system. Russia has also ran campaigns in Lativa and Estonia to encourage native Russians to 
   hold protests there due to not fully recognized rights as citizens.

</h4><br>
<h4>
  Putin has also used oil to leverage alliances with other European nations. Russia tends to use that 
  to their political advantage. The West of course, has objected to all of Russia's malicious actions.
  Russia however, has responded using denial and dismissal of the accusations. Russia even helps allies hide 
  their horrid crimes. 
</h4><br>
<h4>
  People want to know what the west will do about all of this, the West lack of answer 
  makes people question if the West is doing similar crimes. The West has stepped up their actions in 
  various huge efforts. It's so far been working but there is concern Russia will catch up and prevent 
  these defensive responses from being effective. Many tech companies for example have joined in Paris 
  Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace to curve Russia's actions. Fifty countries have signed this agreement. 
  Russia, China, and the US eem to refuse to give up their total sovereignty to sign up for these things.
  This leads to these to nations posing their own threats.
</h4><br>
<h4>
  Europe is recognizing China's agressive tactics to take Europe's key technology and infrastructure.
They've done this through strategic trade and aquisitions. China's investment in Europe ended up being 
nine times greater than the US. China seems to target companies conducting research in robotics and AI.
