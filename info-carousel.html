excersise patterns and progress to give them an idea of how to proceed. It can also guide them to learn new 
excersise skills and track their progress. AI is also helping blind people be able to join the workforce. They are 
able to build robot parts from scratch using computer programs.All of this work in the AI space 
and government support is allowing China to drive the direction of AI innovation. Companies hope to
make this market more open and accepting of a more international workforce.

  Radlink is a Singaporean company using digital programs to run molecular CT and PET scans more 
  quickly and safely. CT and PET scans take less time and cut radiation exposure by 50 percent. Patient comfort is 
  also optimized. Singapore Radio Pharmaceuticals, Radlink's sister company, has Singapore's sr-only
   Cyclotron, a group of  technologies that make different radio-isotopes that allow for research of multiple 
   different diseases, particularly different cancers. These isotopes have short half lives so transporting 
   them to clinics so the most efficient route is picked out by a computer to get them to their destination 
   as soon as possible. SRP must also make and transport dyes patients take that make the scan images much 
   more detailed.

The International Antartica Centre in New Zealand is a place where people get to witness and interact with 
the animals, equipment, and technology that can be found in Antartica. They can climb and ride in the type of
vehicles used. There's a flight simulator allowing guests an aerial tour of the continent. Guests can even experience
a realistic artic storm with -8 degree Celcius temperature and winds that are -18 degrees Celcius.

There's an underwater robot that is able to take sonograph pictures pf the landscape beneath the 
ice of Antartica. This allows for a much better understanding of the local environmet when going forward
with climate saving research.

 <h4>
     Drones carry technology that allows the health of local whales, krill fish and otters to
      be monitored, protecting the sea animals of Antartica. They use software to learn why whales travel to
      that area and how they feed and also how climate change impacts these patterns.

Colorado's I70 road is set to be the first "Smart Road" using self driving car technology or computers giving drivers real time information, and cutting edge road 
to allow cars to communicate with each other and self regulate according to road conditions. This will reduce accidents by at 
least 80 percent and potentially quadruple road capacity.

     The Inverter, the brain of any solar panel system, is currently still very big and bulky. HD wave technology
     is providing a revolution in the construction of inverters. The system uses high definition digital 
     accessing to make high definition waves. They require less magnetics, fewer cooling components,
     which make the design smaller and lighter. They are also more efficient and reliable. This 
     helps solar energy as a whole become more viable.

    <u>Pill Cam</u>  is a pill that, when swallowed goes to and through your colon, taking pictures 
     to take the place of a colonoscopy. Except it can only detect problems - it cannot actually fix the problems.
     If a problem is detected, an actual colonoscopy might be needed. The pill is taken and the pictures it takes are saved to an outside recorder
     allowing a doctor to view these images. The colon and camera disolve so there's no retrieval needed.
     No anestesia is needed either. The patient can immediately return to work.
